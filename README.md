I built this site as a copycat of the google search engine. It looks like google search and functions like google search.

The way it works:

	1. The user enters a search word in the textbox
	
	2. PHP code executes in the background to find text or images (already gathered by crawl.php) concerning the search word
	
	3. The user is directed to links and images concerning the search word
	
	4. Search terms are added to the database and ranked in order of use; the most visited site or image appears first in the search results
